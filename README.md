## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Choosing a movie for a group of people with diverse preferences can be
a time-consuming and frustrating task. Existing recommendation systems primarily focus on
individual preferences and do not effectively cater to group dynamics. Our project aims to
streamline this process by providing a smart movie recommendation system that considers
the choices of multiple users and suggests the most suitable movie while also presenting
relevant details and ratings.

## üí° Solution <a name = "solution"></a>

Our system collects movie preferences from a group of users, processes
their choices using a weighted recommendation algorithm, and suggests the most suitable
movie based on collective preferences. The application integrates the TMDB API to fetch movie
details, including ratings, ensuring informed decision-making.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Innovation And Impact <a name = "iai"></a>

Our project introduces a collaborative filtering approach tailored for
group decision-making, setting it apart from traditional recommendation systems that focus
on individual users. The use of real-time TMDb ratings adds credibility and
transparency to the recommendations. By simplifying the movie selection process for
groups, this project enhances social experiences, making movie nights more enjoyable and
efficient. Additionally, the system's adaptability to various genres and user preferences
makes it a valuable tool for any movie-watching scenario.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
